## Motivation
<details>
  <summary>You had me at macabre and suggestive humor</summary>      
  This project began as my midcourse capstone for Nashville Software School's Data Science Bootcamp. As I started to explore potential datasets, I came upon a list of bizarre and funny reasons given to justify MPAA ratings assigned to movies. (One of which, from the 2019 animated version of The Addams Family, is noted above!    

  This piqued my curiosity.    

  To satisfy my curious nature, I will complete a text analysis of these MPAA rating reasons to see what trends there are to discover. This is my first time performing text analysis, and part of my motivation is the opportunity to learn more about tools and methods for effectively uncovering the insights held within text-based information.
